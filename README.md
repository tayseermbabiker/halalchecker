## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- OpenAI API key (for image analysis)
- Web server (for local development) or hosting platform

### Setup Instructions

1. **Download the files**
   - All files should be in your project directory:
     - `index.html` (main app file)
     - `manifest.json` (PWA configuration)
     - `sw.js` (service worker)
     - `README.md` (this file)

2. **Get an OpenAI API Key**
   - Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key
   - Replace `'your-openai-api-key'` in `index.html` with your actual key

3. **Create App Icons**
   Create PNG icons in these sizes and save them in your project folder:
   - `icon-72.png` (72x72 pixels)
   - `icon-96.png` (96x96 pixels)
   - `icon-128.png` (128x128 pixels)
   - `icon-144.png` (144x144 pixels)
   - `icon-152.png` (152x152 pixels)
   - `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
   - `icon-384.png` (384x384 pixels)
   - `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

   **Icon Design Suggestions:**
   - Use a mosque symbol or Islamic design
   - Use green color scheme (#2E7D32)
   - Make sure they're square and clear at small sizes

4. **Local Development**
   Option A - Python:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\New folder\Projects\Halal-WebApp"
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open: http://localhost:8000

   Option B - Live Server (VS Code):
   - Install "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click `index.html` â†’ "Open with Live Server"

5. **Deploy to Web**
   
   **Netlify (Recommended):**
   - Drag and drop your project folder to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Your app will be live with a custom URL
   - Enable HTTPS automatically

   **Vercel:**
   - Upload to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
